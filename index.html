      <h1>SID</h1>

      <p>
        hi myself sidhartha. i am from odisha , i am 24 years old and currently perusing Btech. on trident academy of
        technology ,BBSR.I currently oversee two teams in my new role at the organisation I joined in 2015. I like to
        think that my skills can be valuable for your company.

        I make it a point to spend the weekends with my family and visit my parents who live down the block. Fitness is
        important to me, and I believe that working out at the company gym can cultivate strong camaraderie between
        colleagues




        Sure! So I've always enjoyed writing and public speaking, even going back to high school. This led me to pursue
        writing-related passions, for example in college, where I was an editor for our school newspaper. In addition to
        writing, I got to learn how to manage a team and the writing process. After college, I took a job at Acme as a
        social media manager, writing copy and social content for the company blog, but I raised my hand to work on the
        communications plan for a product launch which is where I discovered my interest in product marketing. After
        switching to a product marketing role and managing the two most successful new product launches last year, I
        realized I'm excited to take on a new role. I've learned I work best on products that I love and use, and given
        that I'm a big user of your company’s products I jumped at the chance to apply when I saw the open posting.

        <p>Critical Thinking: Companies prefer it when employees can take the initiative and don’t require
          micromanaging. Critical thinking is essential in every industry, regardless of whether you’re a bar manager or
          a nurse. Skills within this group include creativity, innovation, and resourcefulness.
          Interpersonal: The ability to communicate clearly with those around you is invaluable. With good interpersonal
          skills, you get people on your side and help a company achieve its objectives. Important interpersonal skills
          include leadership, listening, and negotiation.
          Problem-Solving: There is no such thing as smooth sailing in any job. Someone with problem-solving skills
          understands this and doesn’t panic when something goes awry. Instead, they gather information and use
          innovative thinking and logic to drive their decision-making. Relevant skills include assertiveness, humility,
          and teamwork.</p>
